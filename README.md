## 📚 Projects

### [![Movie Recommender](https://img.shields.io/badge/Movie%20Recommender-System-orange?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/SrijanChakraborty/Movie-Recommender-System)

This project is a machine learning-based recommendation engine that suggests movies to users based on their preferences. Using a collaborative filtering algorithm, the system analyzes user behavior and movie ratings to provide personalized movie recommendations. It handles large datasets efficiently and is scalable for real-world applications. The system also incorporates content-based filtering to recommend movies based on genres, actors, and directors. This project demonstrates proficiency in data preprocessing, similarity measures, and recommendation techniques.

### [![Live Streaming App]

This **cross-platform mobile application** (developed using **Flutter** or **React Native**) enables real-time video broadcasting and viewing. The backend is powered by **Firebase** for user authentication and managing stream metadata. It utilizes a dedicated **RTMP server/third-party service** for low-latency video transmission and features a **chat function** for live user interaction. The project demonstrates expertise in handling streaming protocols, state management in cross-platform development, and secure real-time database operations.

### [![Parental Control App]

An **Android-specific** application designed to help parents monitor and manage their children's device usage. Key features include **app usage tracking**, **website filtering** via Accessibility Services, and **real-time location monitoring** using Firebase Geolocation services. The app utilizes **Android's permission model** (e.g., Device Administrator and Usage Stats API) for core functionality and ensures secure data transmission and storage with **Firebase Firestore**. This project highlights proficiency in Android system-level development and robust security implementation.



### [![Personalized Medicine Recommender](https://img.shields.io/badge/Personalized%20Medicine%20Recommending%20System-blue?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/SrijanChakraborty/Personalized-Medicine-Recommender)
This system uses machine learning to recommend personalized medicines for patients based on their medical history, genetic information, and other health-related factors. It integrates healthcare data to train models that can predict the most effective treatments for individual patients. The goal is to enhance healthcare by providing tailored medication recommendations, improving patient outcomes, and minimizing side effects. The project involves advanced techniques like feature selection, data analysis, and model evaluation.
