### ![Movie Recommender Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SrijanChakraborty/<repository-name>/main/assets/logo.png) [Movie Recommender System](https://github.com/SrijanChakraborty/Movie-Recommender-System)

This project is a machine learning-based recommendation engine that suggests movies to users based on their preferences. Using a collaborative filtering algorithm, the system analyzes user behavior and movie ratings to provide personalized movie recommendations. It handles large datasets efficiently and is scalable for real-world applications. The system also incorporates content-based filtering to recommend movies based on genres, actors, and directors. This project demonstrates proficiency in data preprocessing, similarity measures, and recommendation techniques.

### [Personalized Medicine Recommending System](https://github.com/SrijanChakraborty/Personalized-Medicine-Recommender)
This system uses machine learning to recommend personalized medicines for patients based on their medical history, genetic information, and other health-related factors. It integrates healthcare data to train models that can predict the most effective treatments for individual patients. The goal is to enhance healthcare by providing tailored medication recommendations, improving patient outcomes, and minimizing side effects. The project involves advanced techniques like feature selection, data analysis, and model evaluation.
